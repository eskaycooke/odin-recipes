     that extra golden, crispy, caramelised and flakey finish! <br>
     The BEST Salmon In Foil IS RIGHT HERE! <br>
    So simple with minimal mess to clean up!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
 <ul>
        
    <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
    <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
    <li>4 large cloves garlic , crushed</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (juice of 1/2 a lemon)</li>
    <li>1.2 kg | 2 1/2 pound side of salmon</li>
    <li>Sea salt , to taste</li>
    <li>Cracked pepper , to taste (optional)</li>
    <li>Lemon slices (to serve)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley</li>
    </ul></u>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Position a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat oven to 375°F | 190°C. <br>
            Line a baking tray / sheet 
            with a large piece of foil, big enough to fold over and seal <br>
            to create a packet (or 2 long pieces of
             foil over lapping each other lengthways to create your salmon packet, <br>
             depending on the width of your fillet).</li>
           <br> 
        <li>In a small saucepan, melt the butter over low-medium heat. Add the honey, garlic and lemon, and <br>
                whisk until the honey has melted through the butter and the mixture is well combined.</li>
                <br>
        <li>Place the salmon onto lined baking tray | sheet. Pour the butter/honey mixture over <br>
                the salmon, and using a pastry brush or spoon, spread evenly over the salmon. Sprinkle with<br>
                 a good amount of salt (about 2 teaspoons) and cracked pepper.<br>
                 Fold the sides of the foil over 
                 the salmon to cover and completely seal the packet closed so the butter does not leak.</li>
                 <br>
        <li>Bake until cooked through (about 15-18 minutes, depending on the thickness of your fish and your<br>
                 preference of doneness). Open the foil, being careful of any escaping steam, <br>
                 and grill / broil under 
              the grill / broiler for 2-3 minutes on medium heat to caramelise the top. <br>

              </bt>Garnish with parsley and 
                 serve immediately with lemon slices.</li>
                
    </ol>

   <div> <p>Pappardelle is a variety of ribbon pasta thatâ€™s flat and much wider than,
     say, fettuccine.

    Usually served with hearty sauces and chunks of game meat,
    pappardelle pasta recipes are super satisfying and family-friendly.</p></div>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
   <div><ul class ="center">
        <li>1  3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
             </li>

            <li>1 cup semolina flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            
           <li>6 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            
          <li>  4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            
           <li> Salt</li>
            
            </ul></div>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>

   <div> <ol class="center">
        <li>Make the dough. Sift both flours together on a large work surface and 
            make a well in the center. Place the eggs, olive oil and a pinch of salt
            in a bowl, then pour into the well; with a fork, break up the eggs, 
             then gradually mix the wet ingredients into the flour mixture just until combined.
            </li>
        
        <li>Knead by hand. Gather the dough into 2 equal-size balls; flour the surface.
            To knead each piece, push the dough away from you with the heel of your hand,
            fold the dough over itself and turn it counterclockwise. 
            Continue pushing, folding and turning until the dough is smooth
            and elastic, 4 to 5 minutes </li>
            
        <li>Rest the dough. Pat each piece into a ball. Flatten slightly, wrap in plastic
            and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.
             (You can freeze 1 ball for 
            later, or roll out both and freeze the cut pasta.)</li>
            
        <li>Roll out the dough. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and dust
            with flour. Starting in the middle, push away from you with a rolling pin,
            easing up on the pressure as you approach the edge. Continue rolling the dough
            into a sheet, turning occasionally, until you can see your fingers
            through the bottom. Let dry about 10 minutes.</li>
            
        <li>Cut the pappardelle. Dust the top of the sheet of dough with flour and loosely
            roll it into a cylinder. Using a sharp knife, cut into 3/4-inch-wide slices.
            Unwrap the noodles; dust with semolina and gently toss to separate. Place on a sheet pan
             and cover with a tea towel until ready to cook
             (or freeze in freezer bags for up to 2 months).</li>

    <p>Pappardelle is a variety of ribbon pasta thatâ€™s flat and much wider than,
     say, fettuccine.<br>

    Usually served with hearty sauces and chunks of game meat,<br>
    pappardelle pasta recipes are super satisfying and family-friendly.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
     <ul>
        <li>1  3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
             </li>

            <li>1 cup semolina flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            
           <li>6 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            
          <li>  4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            
           <li> Salt</li>
            
            </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough. Sift both flours together on a large work surface and <br>
            make a well in the center. Place the eggs, olive oil and a pinch of salt<br>
            in a bowl, then pour into the well; with a fork, break up the eggs, <br>
             then gradually mix the wet ingredients into the flour mixture just until combined.
            </li>
            <br>
        <li>Knead by hand. Gather the dough into 2 equal-size balls; flour the surface.<br>
            To knead each piece, push the dough away from you with the heel of your hand,<br>
            fold the dough over itself and turn it counterclockwise. <br>
            Continue pushing, folding and turning until the dough is smooth
            and elastic, 4 to 5 minutes </li>
            <br>
        <li>Rest the dough. Pat each piece into a ball. Flatten slightly, wrap in plastic<br>
            and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or overnight.<br>
             (You can freeze 1 ball for 
            later, or roll out both and freeze the cut pasta.)</li>
            <br>
        <li>Roll out the dough. Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and dust<br>
            with flour. Starting in the middle, push away from you with a rolling pin,<br>
            easing up on the pressure as you approach the edge. Continue rolling the dough<br>
            into a sheet, turning occasionally, until you can see your fingers<br>
            through the bottom. Let dry about 10 minutes.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Cut the pappardelle. Dust the top of the sheet of dough with flour and loosely<br>
            roll it into a cylinder. Using a sharp knife, cut into 3/4-inch-wide slices.<br>
            Unwrap the noodles; dust with semolina and gently toss to separate. Place on a sheet pan<br>
             and cover with a tea towel until ready to cook<br>
             (or freeze in freezer bags for up to 2 months).</li>
             <br>
      </ol>

<h1>Creamy Garlic Chicken</h1>
<img src="../recipe-images/chicken2.jpg" alt="Creamy Garlic Chicken"  class="center">
<p><center>Crispy, golden chicken on the outside → tender and succulent on the inside → lightly simmered in a creamy sauce
    with so much flavour. The combination of your dreams! Chicken breasts tend to have a bad reputation for being 
    too dry, chalky or hard to swallow. However, this recipe yields perfectly juicy breasts lightly floured and pan
     fried.</center>

<h2>For the Chicken</h2>

<ul class="center">
    <li>3 large boneless and skinless chicken breasts halved horizontally to make 4</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons flour (all purpose or plain)</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon Black cracked pepper</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>For the Sauce</h2>
<ul class="center">
    <li>5 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
   <li> 1 small onion finely chopped</li>
   <li> 1 whole head of garlic peeled and divided into 10-12 cloves</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup chicken broth (stock</li>
   <li> 1 1/4 cup half and half or heavy cream (or evaporated milk)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, to serve</li>
    <br>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol class="center">
    <li>Season the chicken with salt, garlic powder and pepper.</li><br>
    <li>In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, parmesan cheese. Dredge chicken in the flour mixture; shake off excess.</li><br>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. <br>
        Swirl pan to coat evenly. </li><br>
    <li>Fry 2-3 chicken breasts until golden on each side, cooked through and no longer pink<br>
         (about 4-5 minutes each side, depending on the thickness of your chicken).<br>
          Transfer to a warm plate. Set aside.</li><br>
    <li>Wipe pan over with a sheet of paper towel. Repeat with remaining oil, butter and chicken breasts.<br>
         When cooked, transfer the chicken onto the same plate.</li><br>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium. Sauté the onion in the remaining oil/juices in the pan until softened. </li><br>
    <li>Smash 6 whole cloves of garlic with the blunt edge of the back of a knife</li><br>
    <li>Add the remaining oil to the pan and heat through, mixing it through the onions. Sauté smashed <br>
        garlic cloves and whole garlic cloves until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Add the broth to deglaze<br>
         the pan. Scrape up any browned bits and let simmer and reduce to half, about 5 minutes.</li><br>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Pour in the cream. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer for about 2-3 minutes,<br>
     combining all of the flavours together.</li><br>
    <li>Mix in the parmesan cheese. Continue cooking gently for about 2-3 minutes until cheese melts, <br>
    while stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to your taste. </li><br>
    <li>Add the chicken back into the pan and let simmer for a further 2-3 minutes to<br>
     thicken the sauce to your liking. The chicken breast will soak up all of the delicious flavours.</li><br>
    <li>Garnish with parsley and a little black cracked pepper. 
    Serve over pasta, cauliflower mash, zucchini noodles, rice or mashed potatoes.
